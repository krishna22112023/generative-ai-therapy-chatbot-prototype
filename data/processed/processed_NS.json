If you are enlisted in a later intake as compared to your school cohort, you may be eligible for disruption for further studies, so that you may commence your studies at the same time as your peers who are enlisted in the earlier intake. This allows you to begin your further studies at the same time as your peers from the same school cohort. You will be required to serve your remaining full-time NS in one continuous period. Please note that: GCE A Level holders are typically enlisted between the months of January and April. NSFs from the same local A Level cohort enlisted between January and April may be disrupted from the first Operationally Ready Date of their cohort in November two years later, or one week before the course commencement date for local studies (two weeks for overseas studies), whichever is later. Diploma holders are typically enlisted between the months of May and October. NSFs from the same local diploma cohort enlisted between May and October may be disrupted from the first Operationally Ready Date of their cohort in May two years later, or one week before course commencement date for local studies (two weeks for overseas studies), whichever is later. You may submit your application throughOneNS. During your online application, you will need to submit supporting documents (e.g. letter of offer from the institution) certifying that you have been offered a place in an institution that is funded by the MOE or confers its own degrees.

Most of all, maintain a positive attitude about NS. Serving in a conscript army is a rite of passage for all males in many other countries as well and it helps to develop character and maturity in a crucial part of your life journey from \"boys to men\"! life in NS life in NS Anyone who has been through full-time NS will probably agree that adapting to the rigour of basic training as a recruit is much easier if you are physically fit. Therefore, it is definitely worth the while to invest some time and effort into training for your Pre-Enlistee Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT). Even after passing your Pre-Enlistee IPPT, you should continue to exercise and stay fit so that your body will be ready to deal with the physical demands of being a soldier. Learn more about taking thePre-Enlistee IPPT and its scoring system. Pre-Enlistee IPPT and its scoring system Pre-Enlistee IPPT and its scoring system  Keeping fit does not have to be boring. Engaging in sporting activities is highly recommended for pre-enlistees to maintain their fitness prior to enlistment. We highly recommend these sports:   You will be able to adjust yourself to regimental life better in your assigned uniformed Service by familiarising yourself with the activities in camp and what you will be coming in touch with every day.

While some may find it demanding, it is absolutely critical for maintaining our sovereignty. To understand why, it may be worth spending some time to read through the following information and acquaint yourself with the history and facts of NS. NS is a mandatory conscription and duty that every male citizen and PR must undertake upon attaining the age of 18. NS can be served in theSingapore Armed Forces (SAF),Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)orSingapore Police Force (SPF). Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Singapore Police Force (SPF) NS has been the cornerstone of Singapores defence and security since independence. Our national servicemen form the backbone of these three uniformed Services that keep Singapore safe and secure. To date, more than 900,000 male Singaporeans have served NS and journeyed through this rite of passage. For many, this defining experience bonds servicemen from different backgrounds and across generations. You will be in the active service as a full-time National Serviceman (NSF) for two years. After your full-time NS, you will become an Operationally Ready National Serviceman (NSman). Your NSman obligation will end at the age of 50 if you are an Officer or have special skills. Otherwise, you will serve until the age of 40. The need for NS became clear when Singapore gained independence in 1965. It would not have been possible to raise a regular force of a sufficient size to protect this island state given our small population. For over 50 years, NS has evolved into a national institution that is well accepted and a part of our way of life. Our servicemens roles have also expanded. Beyond protecting Singapore from armed conflicts, our servicemen are now involved in countering terrorism, dealing with the aftermath of natural disasters and tackling health epidemics. In 1975, the first intake of Police full-time National Servicemen was enlisted and deployed for peacetime and emergency functions. The SCDF enlisted its first intake of NSFs in 1981 to provide emergency services to the nation during peacetime and crises. Today, the changing roles of our servicemen reflect the need for NS to evolve and keep pace with the changes in our society as well as our threat environment. NS, as the bedrock of our fighting force and national security, remains critical for Singapores continued survival and success. A strong defence underpins the peace and prosperity we enjoy by safeguarding Singapores independence and sovereignty.

It will take one full day to complete and comprises the following stages: You must comply with the notice to attend the Vocational Assessment.Not complying with the notice is an offence under the Enlistment Act. Offenders shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding  Dollar 10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both. As MINDEF/SAF adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards drug abuse, all SAF servicemen are expected to remain drug free. Abusing drugs will affect your deployment during NS. All drug abusers will be excluded from Command School. As leaders, commanders are expected to be role models. If you wish to be a commander, you should not have taken drugs before.

Plan how you will be spending your post-ord time\nAfter having two years of your life and schedule planned on your behalf, including the exact time you should eat, wake up or sleep and what activities you need to complete daily, life after your ORD might take some getting used to.\nSince you won't have an instructor or commander dictating how you spend your days, you should think about how you spend your time. You can start by defining a daily routine of job-hunting or preparing for school and spending time with family and friends.\nTaking things to the next level, you can set some projects for yourself to accomplish, like getting a driving license, learning a new skill, or exploring a new country and culture.\nFinding your why and defining a vision for yourself will go a long way in helping you make the most of your newfound, albeit short-lived, free time. Ultimately, you need to answer this question for yourself: #WhatsYourWhy? Only then will you be able to spend your post-ORD time meaningfully.\n2. Update your resume\nWhether you are looking for a temporary, part-time or full-time job or applying for higher education, you will need an updated resume and consolidated academic and professional records.\nIn the two years you spent serving national service, your career objectives might have changed, and you might have picked up additional skills and training during the process. Updating your resume and list of skills will allow your resume to more accurately reflect the new person you've grown into.\n3. Upgrade yourself\nA few things in the world and job markets might be different since you started national service. To remain relevant, you should look at upgrading yourself, whether its furthering your studies or going for a course.\nApplication dates for higher education programmes may not coincide with your ORD, so you need to pro-actively research this to ensure you don't miss deadlines and are not left in limbo for months before the next intake.\nFor shorter-term courses, the SkillsFuture programme is a great place to start, regardless of whether you've expended your $500 in credits. Courses on the SkillsFuture scheme are vetted, varied and deemed to be relevant for the workplaces of today and tomorrow.\nAnother way to gain new skills is to take up an internship or part-time job. There are job portals dedicated to internships or temporary positions that you can use to find meaningful opportunities that's right for you.\n4. Maintain your fitness and wellness\nAn aspect you shouldn't neglect is taking care of your fitness and general well-being. After your ORD, there won't be a physical training instructor encouraging (aka yelling) at you to push yourself for every additional push-up, sit-up or pull-up.\nYou also still hold many responsibilities as a National Serviceman (NSman), including booking and clearing your IPPT test annually and keeping fit, at least until the age of 40, to be ready for a call-up.\nTo do this, you will need to find your own ways to stay motivated. This is where AIA Vitality can come in to play a part in motivating you to keep healthy, fit and active. This science-backed wellness programme rewards you with annual cashbacks and discounts on your AIA insurance policies, gym memberships and more as you make small but significant steps towards a healthier lifestyle.\nFind out more about how AIA Vitality can make a real difference in your life today.\n5. Review your insurance policies\nWhen you are no longer a full-time NSman, you will not enjoy 24/7 coverage under the Group Term Life and Group Personal Accident paid for by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).\nAfter your ORD, you also lose access to fully subsidised medical and dental care and treatments at government hospitals and polyclinics. This means that you should review of your existing insurance coverage with your financial advisor to ensure that you and your loved ones continue to enjoy financial security and peace of mind.\nOur financial advisors will be more than happy to help you with such planning. You can contact us here.\nHappy ORD!\nWe understand you've ORD-ed and may want to play catch up on some things you feel you have missed out while in army. However, you should note that you're no longer receiving an allowance from the army, and if you don't work, you may find yourself depleting your savings or overspending. If you do work, you should still ensure you spend wisely and prudently set aside money for your future as you will definitely find yourself taking on more responsibilities and commitments as time goes on.\nFinally, we're grateful that you have contributed to the safety and security of Singapore for two years. During this time, you've also equipped yourself with experiences and networks from your national service, and are now poised to go forth and build the life you envision.",
