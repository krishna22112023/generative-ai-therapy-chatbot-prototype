At Home: - Step 1: Find out more about the available vocations on the CMPB website (videos and handbook). Pre-enlistees are encouraged to explore and learn about the different vocations available in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), and Singapore Police Force (SPF). This information is available through the CMPB website, which includes videos and handbooks. - Step 2: Register for NS and indicate interest in vocations on the NS Portal before medical screening. Pre-enlistees must register for National Service and indicate their vocational interests on the NS Portal. This should be done before attending the medical screening. 2. At CMPB (Central Manpower Base): - Step 3: Attend medical screening. The medical screening assesses the medical fitness of pre-enlistees, which will influence their deployment in NS. 3. Indicating Interest in Vocations: - There are 7 categories of vocations, divided among: - 3 from SAF - 2 from SCDF - 2 from SPF Pre-enlistees can indicate interest in 2 or more vocations in each category. They also have the option to indicate if they have no specific interest in any vocation. - Deployment is based on manpower and operational requirements, as well as the pre-enlistee\u2019s medical fitness, cognitive attributes, skills, and interests. 4. Further Steps After Screening: - Step 4: Enlist into SAF, SCDF, or SPF. Pre-enlistees are formally enlisted into one of the services based on the needs and their qualifications. - Step 5: Undergo basic training. Enlistees undergo basic training to prepare them for their roles in their respective services. - Step 6: Check posting order. After completing basic training, enlistees receive their posting orders, which detail their specific role and unit within the service. 5. Additional Note: The final statement emphasizes that every full-time national serviceman plays an important role regardless of their vocation. They contribute to the national defense and security of Singapore.",
