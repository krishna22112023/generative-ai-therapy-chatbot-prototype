To maintain this positive state, try to stick to a healthy routine - get enough sleep, eat well, exercise regularly, and make time for activities you enjoy. It's also a good idea to keep an eye on how you're feeling and reach out if you notice any changes.",

Don't worry, though - there are lots of things you can do to feel better! Why not try some relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation? Regular exercise can also work wonders for anxiety. It might also help to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. If you find these feelings are persistent or start to increase, consider reaching out to a counselor or joining a support group. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength!",

I can imagine this isn't easy, and I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way. Anxiety at this level can make daily life feel more challenging, but there are ways to manage it and feel better. It might be a good idea to talk to a mental health professional who can provide more personalized support. They might suggest therapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can give you tools to manage anxiety. In the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. Engage in activities that make you feel calm and happy, reach out to supportive friends or family, and remember that it's okay to take breaks when you need them. You're not alone in this, and with the right support, things can get better..",

They can work with you to create a treatment plan, which might include therapy, medication, or other approaches. In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. It's okay to take things one day at a time. Lean on your support system - friends, family, or support groups can be invaluable. Remember, you're showing incredible strength by acknowledging these feelings, and seeking help is a courageous step towards feeling better."
